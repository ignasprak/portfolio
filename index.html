                    Hi, my name is Ignas and weclome to my portfolio website, please feel free to explore
                    anything that catches your eye!
                    <br><br>
                    I am a Technological Univeristy Dublin Computer Science graduate with a 2.1 certificaton. My current
                    hobbies include making electronic music, learning more about football analytics, and
                    playing video games! I am currently going through a community course about how to further improve my
                    data engineering
                    skills.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm passionate about building data-driven solutions that are scalable and impactful. My current goal
                    is to transition into a full-time role in data engineering, where I can apply both my
                    technical and creative skills. I enjoy solving complex problems, learning collaboratively, and
                    staying curious about what I can do
                    to help support the mission I am on.
